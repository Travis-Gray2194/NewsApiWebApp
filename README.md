Write an application with security.

The application will show news to users from newsapi.org. 

Users should be able to register with your website, which will allow them to log in. 

For users who are not logged in, they should see the top news stories. 

For users who are logged in, they should be able to add topics of interest to their profile, and see news stories for each category they select. 

Users can add to and remove from news categories in their profiles, and should see the stories that reflect their choices as soon as they log in.

This application HAS to look professional, but you do not have to use a Creative Tim template.
